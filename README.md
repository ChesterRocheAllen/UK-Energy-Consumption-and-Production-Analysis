# UK Energy Consumption and Production Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on modeling and analyzing the energy consumption and production of the United Kingdom. The primary goal is to understand how energy is consumed and produced across various sectors, including **Transportation**, **Industry**, **Domestic**, and **Service**. By analysing energy data from different sectors, this project aims to provide insights into trends, energy efficiency, and the overall energy transition in the UK.

Key objectives of the project:
- Model UK energy production and consumption by sector.
- Analyze energy usage trends across sectors.
- Examine the role of renewable and non-renewable energy sources.
- Investigate UK energy imports.
- Identify opportunities for improvement in energy efficiency.
- Visualize energy consumption data for better understanding and decision-making.

## UK Energy Consumption 

From the UK government website data was sourced for the energy consumption in the UK as of 2024. After cleaning and sorting the data the UK energy consumption by sector and by fuel was visualized as seen below.
